	 * In normal class, we can not create a abstract methods but we can add 'abstract' keyword and create a abstract method
	 * The moment we create a abstract method in a class, the class will be converted into abstract Class
	 * It is not mandatory to have an abstract method in an Abstract class
	 * We can create either abstract methods or concrete methods or both the methods in abstract Class.
	 * We can not create object for abstract class. Because abstract Class may have abstract methods alone and 
	 * 		in that situation, object creation is useless
